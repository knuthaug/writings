I run. 

I run as fast as my legs can carry me through the tunnels. I don't know what I am running from but 
there is something there, something following me, making strange, guttural sounds. I have always 
been vary of sounds I don't recognize and that has now turned to fear. A fear grabbing me by the 
balls and not letting go. There is so much to fear now, so much more than before.
