I haven't seen the sky in 36 days. 

The colour of it that day was that of dirty concrete, a solid sky, no discernable features in it. It never changes. The air is thick with ozone, the smell surrounds you wherever you go, you can almost taste it when you breathe. The clouds fill the sky but they sadly do not shield us from the UV radiation, they just cover the ground in a bleak uniform light, making all days look the same, making details hard to see in a distance. It is a half light, near dawn feeling. It gets tired after while. It covers the empty shells of the pre-nova world above. 
I could kill for a good sunset. Bu then again, the sunset would most likely kill me.

  
Martin walks through the basement levels of the parking house. It seems empty when his sister is gone, the noise of the other people shuffling around blends into the background. Where is she? Why would she go out without him? Martin ponders. He has asked everybody if they have seen here. Noone has.
- Are you the one looking for your sister?, a grumbling voice says behind him. It belongs to a man Martin haven't seen before, he must have wandered in via the hole connecting the subway to the parking compound. It happens, but more and more seldom. 
- You've seen her? 
- Depends. What can you give me in return, he says, smiling wryly. 
- What do you want? Everybody wants something, everybody needs something. When everything is scarce, you need a lot. The only thing abundant is dirt. And hunger. 
- I have rat, not more than a week old, Martin says. 
- I'll share it with you? Martin doesn't say how much rat, because a little is better than nothing and if he's hungry, it might do. Everybody's hungry. 
- Done, I'll tell you while we are eatingm he says. He says his name is John. It could juts as well be John Smith. Real names are not used lightly. 


I was topside that day, to find my sister. She had gotten lost the day before. I still haven't found her. Do I hope to find her again? I don't know anymore. I take each day as it comes. 


Ozone is a strange element, highly reactive, and the very thing that has encapsulated the earth in a protective cocoon all these years, giving the planet enough shelter from the sun so that life could thrive. Now that very ozone is killing us off, species by species either directly or indirectly. Only one extra atom of oxygen and the very essence of life gives you so much hell. 


  
We stayed at the surface as long as we could, after the blast. At first nothing seemed to change after the supernova, but soon the changes crept up on us, one by one. We
