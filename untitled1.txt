I haven't seen the sky in 36 days. The colour of it that day was that of dirty concrete, a solid sky, 
no discernable features in it. The sky is always like that now. It never changes. I was topside to 
find my sister, which had gotten lost the day before. I still haven't found her. Do I hope to find her again? I don't know anymore. I take each day as it comes.
