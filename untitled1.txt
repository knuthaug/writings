I haven't seen the sky in 36 days. The colour of it that day was that of dirty concrete, a solid sky, no discernable features. It never changes. The air is thick with ozone, the smell surrounds me wherever I go, I can almost taste it when I breathe. The clouds fill the sky but they sadly do not shield us from the UV, they just cover the ground in a bleak uniform light, making all days look the same, making details hard to see in a distance. It is a half light, near dawn feeling. It gets tired after while. It covers the empty shells of the pre-nova world. 
I could kill for a good sunset. Bu then again, the sunset would most likely kill me.


Martin walks through the basement levels of the parking house. It seems empty when his sister is gone, the noise of the other people shuffling around blends into the background. Where is she? Why would she go out without him? Martin ponders. He has asked everybody if they have seen here. Noone has.
- Are you the one looking for your sister?, a grumbling voice says behind him. It belongs to a man Martin haven't seen before, he must have wandered in via the hole connecting the subway to the parking compound. It happens, but more and more seldom. 
- You've seen her?
- Depends. What can you give me in return?, he says, smiling. 
- What do you want? Everybody wants something, everybody needs something. When everything is scarce, you need a lot. The only thing abundant is dirt. And hunger. 
- I have rat, not more than a week old, Martin says. 
- I'll share it with you? Martin doesn't say how much rat, because a little is better than nothing and if he's hungry, it might do. Everybody's hungry. 
- Done, I'll tell you while we are eating, he says. He says his name is John. It could just as well be John Smith. Real names are not used lightly. 
  He doesn't say anything about the small remains of the grilled rat carcass, and Martin rightly assumes he really was that hungry. - I saw your sister, or at least someone who looks like her, a couple of days ago near the surface. I was wondering through the sewer tunnels across the river and stumbled upon a bunch of people. They were just walking in a line, through the tunnel not saying anything, he says between the mouthfuls. 
- Describe her, how she looked, says Martin, not feeling convinced he has atually seen here. 
- Pale, thin with greasy hair. blue jeans and old army boots on her feet, John continues. Martin is not convinced at all. Could be anyone. Well almost. 
- They we just walking along and I tried to talk to them and noone responded, just shuffled along in a monotonus fashion. - In what direction? asked Martin. - West, towards the water treatment plant. 
- I'm not bying it. Martin says. This girl could be anyone. These people could be anyone. 
- Oh, almost forgot, John said, she wore a big bowler hat with a green band on it, at _least_ two sizes too large. 
Martin could feel his heart pick up the pace, thundering in his chest. The rat was definitely worth it. 


The hat was what made it all true. Our father's hat, the one he gave her when he died. She hadn't said any pretentiuos words about wearing the hat in his honour or anything like that. The hat just sort of grew into her, they became symbiotic. The hat and her, always together. It's been so many years since he passed and I have trouble remembering his face sometimes. I wish I could remember it vividly, but I can't, not anymore. But the hat remains. I knew then and there that he was telling me the truth, he had seen her. The water treatment plant? Why there, what could possibly be worth going there for? I don't understand but I have to go there too, to see if I can find here. I have to. 


Martin packed his bag in a hurry, there wasn't much to pack anyway, a sleeping bag the rest of the food the camping stove and the tools. He hid some of the books in a crevice in the wall, maybe they'll be there if he comes back this way. Maybe not. He walked across the open space of the parking space between the groups of people settled there, nobody noticing him, nobody saying anything. He walks out of the hole in the wall and makes his way up the floors. The water treatment plant is only reachable via the surface. On the surface, eyes start to hurt and water after only a few minutes, and the skin burn. The sun screen factor you need is ridiculous and there isn't any to be found anywhere. So night time it is. 
  The cat is sitting in the entrance to parking house, the skin cancer blooming all over its skin, blind as a bat from the radiation. It just sits there, listening for mice or other prey. Martin realizes it's just a matter of time before it dies of hunger, or the cancer. This will probably happen to all of them in time, if we can't fix this atmosphere before it is too late. The cat shuffles into a hole in the wall when Martin walks by, into the open. The sky is dark, overcast of course, and no stars are visible and there is no wind. The taste of ozone is more noticable up here and it makes your throat hurt, so there is always the choice between running and getting under ground fast and frying your lungs and throat, or take your time and get more exposure. Marting walks in the direction of the zoo, where he knows there is an entrance to sewer tunnels. 







NOTES:

Ozone is a strange element, highly reactive, and the very thing that has encapsulated the earth in a protective cocoon all these years, giving the planet enough shelter from the sun so that life could thrive. Now that ozone is killing us off, species by species either directly or indirectly. Only one extra atom of oxygen and the essence of life gives you so much hell. 


  
We stayed at the surface as long as we could, after the blast. At first nothing seemed to change after the supernova, but soon the changes crept up on us, one by one. We
